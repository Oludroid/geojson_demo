  <p>The map shows the pictures of the ten businesses that I observed in Downtown Lincoln. The blue markers indicate businesses that complied with CDC directives with regards to the use of masks and social distancing. The red markers indicate unsafe businesses, and the only black marker indicates a business that folded up because of the Covid-19 Pandemic.</p>
